# SteamSeek Refactoring Guide

This guide explains the incremental refactoring of the SteamSeek application to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Current Refactoring Progress

The application has been refactored from a monolithic structure to a modular blueprint-based architecture. Here's what has been done so far:

1. Created a blueprint structure:
   - `blueprints/search.py`: Search functionality
   - `blueprints/auth.py`: Authentication
   - `blueprints/lists.py`: User game lists
   - `blueprints/games.py`: Game details and notes

2. Implemented core search functionality in the search blueprint
3. Set up a new application entry point (`app_refactored.py`) that uses the blueprints

## How to Run the Refactored Application

To run the refactored version of the application:

```bash
python app_refactored.py
```

This will start the Flask development server with the new modular structure. The application should function the same as before, but with a more maintainable codebase.

## Next Steps for Refactoring

Here are the next steps to continue improving the codebase:

### 1. Complete Deep Search Implementation

The `deep_search_background_task` in `blueprints/search.py` needs to be fully implemented with the actual task processing logic from the original app.py file.

### 2. Move Regular Search Background Task

Implement the `regular_search_background_task` function in `blueprints/search.py` with the logic from app.py.

### 3. Replace Thread-based Background Processing

Replace the current thread-based background processing with a proper job queue using Celery or Redis Queue (RQ):

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install celery redis
   ```

2. Create a `tasks.py` file to define Celery tasks
3. Update search blueprint to use Celery tasks instead of threads

### 4. Add Unit Tests

Create a comprehensive test suite to ensure the application works correctly:

1. Create a `tests` directory
2. Implement unit tests for each blueprint
3. Add integration tests for critical flows

### 5. Improve Error Handling

Standardize error responses across the application:

1. Create a dedicated error handler module
2. Implement consistent error response format
3. Add proper logging for all errors

### 6. Optimize Data Loading

Consider improving the data loading mechanism:

1. Move game data to a proper database (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
2. Implement data caching with Redis
3. Create a data update mechanism

## Best Practices for Ongoing Development

When continuing to develop the application, follow these best practices:

1. **Keep Blueprints Focused**: Each blueprint should handle a specific domain of functionality
2. **Use Blueprint Route Prefixes**: Consider using URL prefixes for blueprints (e.g., `/auth`, `/lists`)
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Follow the same error reporting pattern across all blueprints
4. **Configuration Management**: Store configuration values in a dedicated config file or environment variables
5. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to all functions and comment complex logic
6. **Type Hints**: Use Python type hints to improve code readability and enable static type checking

## Testing the Refactored Code

Before fully replacing the original app.py, test the refactored version thoroughly:

1. Test all major functionality: search, auth, game details, lists
2. Check for regression issues
3. Verify the application works in different environments

Once you're confident the refactored version works correctly, you can rename `app_refactored.py` to `app.py` to replace the original implementation.
