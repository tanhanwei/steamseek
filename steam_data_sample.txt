A great addition to the seek and find genre. \n\n[h2][u]Gameplay & Features[/u][/h2]\n\nSettings include; audio controls. \n\nIf you wish to put your game into windowed mode, put [i]-screen-width 1920 -screen-height 1080[/i] (or a resolution of your choice) under properties in the games Steam library page under launch options and relaunch the game. Then after relaunch just hit alt+enter for it to resize. \n\n[u]Highlights[/u]\n\n* Contains two maps (both with a dark blue background). \n* As you find items it unlocks the next set of items to find. Each item is colored in and lights up when you find them. \n* You can pan the map zoomed in with WASD controls (very nice feature). \n* A hint system that does not penalize you to use it (no achievements attached to it). \n* You can choose what you want to use a hint for (each item has an individual hint button but once used all of them have a reset timer). \n* Easy to earn achievements\n* Hand drawn art that is fun and cute \n* Very relaxing lo-fi soundtrack to listen to while playing \n* Some pretty funny elves (I see the little one wee-weeing in the snow) :) \n\n[h2][u]Overall Experience[/u][/h2]\n\nA really cute Christmas themed seek and find at a great price. The game uses the same lighting mechanic found in another game in the genre called Hidden Capybaras with Orange (another series I love) where the found items not only color in but light up and glow. It really makes for a magical effect. The map also wraps around itself so there are no side edges (at least in windowed mode) so the map just scrolls over seamlessly. I really enjoyed this little gem from the [i]Galysh Company[/i] and hope they do more in the future. 🌟\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/] Follow [b]IndieGems[/b] [/url] for more reviews like this one.

It has a nice aesthetic with its neon soaked backdrop, common in a few other hidden object games I have played, but it looks nice and gives it a wintry feel. The music is very relaxing and it is easy to drift away looking for those illusive objects. \n\nAll the objects you need to find are not just winter based, like snowmen and candles, but also there are fairy tale objects like elves, and Santa Claus to locate. Down the bottom on a toolbar sits the objects you need to find with a counter for how many you have left. At the beginning everything is locked apart from the elves, and as you find so many of them, other items start to unlock as you progress, so it is a case of going over the same ground as new objects are revealed. \n\nThere are two scenes for you to try, which you can alternate between because your progress saves, and there are achievements to earn for collecting all the objects, and some for locating special items on the page which might not necessarily be on the toolbar. You aren't told what these are so a bit of guess work is needed, or just look at the achievement name! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422774659\n\nThe items can be quite difficult to find and I did get stuck on some, especially the envelopes, but there are hints with a generous timer if you want to use them. The hint sends you to the general area where the item is located. It actually took me a while to realize that there was actually a hint option because I could not find a separate button for a hint anywhere, but later realized there is a magnifying glass on each object on the toolbar. How did I miss that? \n\nIf you use the hints then you will whiz through the game, and there are no penalties for using them apart from the timer on the next hint, but otherwise it could take you up to an hour to complete both scenes which is good value for money considering its price tag. \n\n[h1]🍳Conclusion🍳[/h1]\n[quote][h2][b] Hidden Winter Things [/b] was a fun experience for an hour and ticked all the boxes that a hidden object game should. Perhaps it could have had more scenes but considering its price tag I think that is expected. \n\nThe scene looks nice, the music is very relaxing, there are achievements, and the objects do pose some challenge to those who don't use hints. \n\nOverall, I could recommend this to hidden object lovers.

Unlike most comparable games, which only lets you look for one type of object, this one unlocks additional objects to keep things interesting.\n\nNew objects are unlocked by finding Christmas elves. There are quite a few of them, and each increases the bar at the bottom. When you find a specific number of elves, you open an icon with the new object. Each scene contains ten different objects, and all revolve around Christmas.\n\nThere is no penalty for clicking in the wrong location or clicking quickly, but you cannot click on an object until its icon is unlocked. The numbers for each object indicate exactly how many are hidden in the scene. One nice aspect of the image is that it is continuous; you can scroll left or right and continue indefinitely because the scene will simply loop.\n\nAnother unique element is that the settings are a little dark, and each found object gets color, brightening up the surroundings slightly. Because the whole thing is casual, each type of object has a hint that creates a circle around the object. The only rule is that it needs to recharge for a time.", "timestamp_created": 1735122396, "timestamp_updated": 1735122396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585831761360168457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184166224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310043798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1735508670}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]My inner Grinch feels content with just the right amount of X-Mas festivity![/h1]\nThis seems to be the first game developed by Galysh Company, and will grant you about 30–40 minutes of Christmas-themed find and seek.\nWith two different levels available. You’ll be tasked with finding a variety of things; from little elves to snowflakes, every single task will be filled with the merriment sentiment typical of the season we are currently in.\nThe progress within the two levels will consist of unlocking the next target to spot on the map, parting from the starting line of finding little mischievous elves, and each time you do, magic will take place, illuminating your findings as if you were lighting up your own Christmas tree, adding more and more to the overall picture, step by step. Or better be said, “click by click”...\n\nOn the first map, aside from the elves, you’ll have up to 40 items to find, whilst on the second one the task will be a new challenge, making it up to 70 in total!\n\nAt the beginning, the secondary objectives (so to speak) will be locked, until you spot a certain number of elves, which will be the key to keeping unlocking the other mysterious items to be found.\n\nI believe I spotted Olaf from Frozen and if it wasn’t him, let’s just say it was a close relative… *cough*\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3395490817\nThe game does count with Steam Cloud available, albeit there’s an option for you to be able to re-play any of them separately without deleting the progress on the other one.\n\n[h1]Gameplay and Features:[/h1]\nThe mouse sensitivity may feel a little high at the beginning but you’ll be able to navigate through the scenery with (W, A, S, D) and I found the option personally more comfortable. However, the zoom-in feature is well-designed!\n\nThe hint system is rechargeable, and even if the option does appear atop each one of the tasks listed in the bar below, they do not function individually. Meaning that the cooldown will be applied to all of them every time you click on the hint tool.\nThe background music felt really nice and cozy, and I really loved the piano tune. For once, the themes didn’t get stuck in my head as it normally happens to me.\n\nThe game has thirteen easily obtainable achievements.\nOne of its titles made me laugh really hard, but I reckon it is not the only surprise you’ll find in different ways within this little game. I will leave a spoiler text regarding the said achievement in case anyone’s wondering what I am talking about!\n[spoiler]I spotted a couple of elves sharing quite a beautiful moment together, and I found another one second later, making the achievement jump and so a chuckle escaped me as my eyes landed on the title ‘There’s clearly a third wheel here’[/spoiler]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3395488618\nA curious feature I encountered is the fact of simply being able to keep sliding through the scenery in one direction or another since the map is looped!\nAnd I must say something got me confused on the second map, given I spotted one of the items asked of me. It was basically in plain sight, which made me smirk, thinking it would be an easy prey. So I clicked and nothing happened… I spent a bit clicking like a mad woman, believing it could be a bug, given that sometimes I seem to be such a summoner in those regards. So, I decided to keep up with my quest as Gerald of Rivia while searching for Ciri, with determination, yet taking my time… In the end, it resulted in it not being necessary, given it didn’t count. So I obtained all the achievements and also an incomprehensible need to play Gwent! *I’m joking though*\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3395487807\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nIt was a cute experience filled with objectives that earned a couple of chuckles on my part, given the little mischievous jokes hidden here and there. For fans of the genre or even newcomers at an affordable price!\n\nTrust Witchy would like to thank Galysh Company for the opportunity given to the group by providing a review copy of this game.\n[quote][h2][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44684285/]Trust Witchy wanted to create some mischief here, leaving a trace in the shape of a review![/url][/h2][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1735515692, "timestamp_updated": 1735567975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584190607070922852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "185612344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317632100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1737925545}, "language": "english", "review": "I am smitten by this adorable, cozy, relaxing and charming little game.
