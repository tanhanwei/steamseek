# LLM Development Challenges & Strategies

This document tracks challenges encountered when using LLMs for development on this project, along with effective strategies to address them.

## Common LLM Limitations

### 1. Context Window Limitations

**Challenge**: LLMs have limited context windows and may lose track of the full codebase structure.

**Strategies**:
- Provide high-level architecture summary in every conversation
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Create "signpost" comments in complex files

**Examples**:
- When discussing the search blueprint, explicitly mention `blueprints/search.py`
- Use standard prefixes for functions (e.g., `perform_` for actions, `get_` for retrievers)

### 2. Code Generation Consistency

**Challenge**: LLMs may generate code that doesn't follow project conventions or introduces inconsistencies.

**Strategies**:
- Provide example code snippets when requesting new features
- Explicitly state code style preferences
- Review generated code carefully before implementation
- Create standard patterns for common operations

**Examples**:
- Error handling in Flask routes follows standard pattern: try/except with jsonify response
- Consistent parameter ordering in functions (e.g., `appid` always first parameter)

### 3. Complex Operations Understanding

**Challenge**: LLMs sometimes struggle with complex asynchronous operations, state management, and thread safety.

**Strategies**:
- Break complex tasks into smaller, well-defined steps
- Explicitly explain threading and state requirements
- Use established patterns for async code
- Provide clear documentation for complex operations

**Examples**:
- Background search tasks use a standard pattern with status dictionaries
- Global state is clearly marked with comments

### 4. Full Feature Implementation

**Challenge**: LLMs may not fully implement all edge cases or proper error handling.

**Strategies**:
- Create checklists for feature requirements
- Explicitly ask for error handling
- Review and test code thoroughly
- Create test cases before implementation

**Examples**:
- Standard checklist for API endpoints: validation, authentication, error handling, success response
- Test cases specify expected behavior for edge cases

## Specific Project Challenges

### Search Implementation

**Challenge**: Complex search logic with multiple steps and background processing

**Strategies**:
- Created clear documentation of the search flow
- Broke search into distinct phases (query, processing, filtering, sorting)
- Used status dictionaries with well-defined fields

### Firebase Integration

**Challenge**: LLMs sometimes struggle with Firebase SDK usage

**Strategies**:
- Provided standard patterns for Firebase operations
- Created utility functions for common operations
- Added explicit error handling for Firebase calls

### JavaScript UI Interactions

**Challenge**: Complex frontend interactions with vanilla JavaScript

**Strategies**:
- Used consistent event handling patterns
- Structured JavaScript code in modules
- Created helper functions for common operations

## Effective Prompting Techniques

### 1. Structured Feature Requests

When requesting features, use this structure:
```
Feature: [Brief description]

Context:
- [Relevant files and components]
- [Current limitations or issues]
- [User requirements]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [List of specific requirements]
- [Expected behavior]
- [Error handling requirements]

Examples:
- [Example inputs and expected outputs]
- [Edge cases to consider]
```

### 2. Bug Fix Requests

When requesting bug fixes, use this structure:
```
Bug: [Brief description]

Reproduction:
- [Steps to reproduce]
- [Expected behavior]
- [Actual behavior]

Context:
- [Relevant files and components]
- [Related features]

Possible Causes:
- [Any suspected issues]
- [Recent changes that might be related]
```

### 3. Code Review Requests

When requesting code review, use this structure:
```
Review Request: [Brief description]

Files to Review:
- [List of files]

Focus Areas:
- [Specific concerns]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Security implications]
- [Maintainability aspects]
```

## Best Practices for LLM Collaboration

1. **Break tasks into manageable chunks**: Request one coherent feature at a time
2. **Provide clear context**: Start with a summary of what's already implemented
3. **Specify constraints**: Clearly state performance, security, or design constraints
4. **Iterative approach**: Build on successful code rather than rewriting from scratch
5. **Keep documentation updated**: Update docs as features evolve
6. **Track progress**: Document what was successful and what failed
7. **Maintain consistent conventions**: Establish patterns and stick to them
