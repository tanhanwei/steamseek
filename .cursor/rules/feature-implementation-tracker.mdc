# Feature Implementation Tracker

Type: Agent Requested
Description: Ensures [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) and [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) are updated when implementing or modifying features

## Purpose

This rule ensures that whenever features are implemented or modified, the DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md files are updated to reflect the current development status accurately.

## Instructions for AI

When implementing or modifying features, you MUST update the documentation to maintain an accurate record of development progress. Follow these specific instructions:

### Updates Required in [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)

1. **Task Tracking**:
   - Mark completed tasks with a checkmark (`- [x]`)
   - Update the status of in-progress tasks
   - Add any new tasks identified during implementation

2. **Priority Updates**:
   - Move tasks between priority sections if their urgency has changed
   - Update estimated effort or timelines if they've changed

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Update the "Technical Debt Tracking" table if:
     - New technical debt was introduced (add an entry)
     - Existing debt was addressed (update status)
     - Debt priority changed (update priority)

4. **Dependencies and Blockers**:
   - Update the dependencies section if implementation revealed new dependencies
   - Remove blockers that have been resolved

### Updates Required in [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)

1. **Current Development Status**:
   - Update the status for relevant components in the table
   - Change status indicators as appropriate (‚úÖ Complete, üîÑ In Progress, ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement)

2. **Recent Changes**:
   - Add a bullet point describing the feature implementation
   - Be specific about what was added or modified

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Update this section if the implementation changed the technical debt situation

4. **Current Development Priorities**:
   - Update priorities if the implementation affects what should be done next

### Be Thorough and Precise

- Be specific about what was implemented and what remains to be done
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Maintain the document structure and style
- Focus updates on facts rather than opinions

### Final Step

Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of both documents to today's date.

## Confirmation Requirement

After updating documentation, briefly confirm which documents were updated and summarize the key changes made.
