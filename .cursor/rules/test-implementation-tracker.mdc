# Test Implementation Tracker

Type: Auto Attached
File Patterns: tests/**/*.py, **/test_*.py

## Purpose

This rule ensures that whenever tests are created or modified, the [TESTING_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/TESTING_ROADMAP.md) file is updated to reflect the current testing status accurately.

## Instructions for AI

When implementing or modifying tests, you MUST update the [TESTING_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/TESTING_ROADMAP.md) file to maintain an accurate record of test coverage. Follow these specific instructions:

### Updates Required in [TESTING_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/TESTING_ROADMAP.md)

1. **Test Status Tables**:
   - Update the status column for the relevant component (üîÑ Partial or ‚úÖ Complete)
   - Add any new test files to the appropriate table

2. **Critical Test Cases**:
   - Check off (`[x]`) test cases that have been implemented
   - Add any new test cases that were identified during implementation

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Update the completion status of testing milestones
   - Update the overall test coverage percentage if known

4. **Testing Notes**:
   - Add any important observations about test implementation
   - Document any challenges or considerations for future testing

### Be Specific and Accurate

- Indicate exactly which tests were implemented
- Use consistent formatting for status indicators:
  - ‚úÖ Complete
  - üîÑ Partial
  - ‚ùå Not Started
- Include specific file names and test function names in your updates
- Document any test fixtures or mocks that were created

### Update [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)

Also update the "Testing Status" section in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with:
- The latest test coverage information
- Any significant testing milestones reached
- Updated count of tests by type (unit, integration, functional)

### Final Step

Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of both [TESTING_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/TESTING_ROADMAP.md) and [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) to today's date.

## Confirmation Requirement

After updating documentation, briefly confirm which testing documentation was updated and summarize the changes made.
