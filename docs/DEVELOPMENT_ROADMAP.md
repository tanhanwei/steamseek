# SteamSeek Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development tasks, prioritized by importance and timeline.

## Current Development Phase: Proof of Concept Optimization

We are currently focused on optimizing the proof of concept for a small user base (~5 concurrent users). 
The goal is to improve quality, maintainability, and testability before scaling to more users.

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Testing Framework Implementation
- [ ] Setup pytest with basic fixtures
- [ ] Implement critical path unit tests for search functionality
- [ ] Implement basic integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Create standardized error response format
- [ ] Implement global error handler for API routes
- [ ] Add better user feedback for errors
- [ ] Improve validation for user inputs

### 3. Search Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize search result processing
- [ ] Improve deep search throttling
- [ ] Enhance caching for repeat searches
- [ ] Add timeout handling for LLM requests

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading indicators for all async operations
- [ ] Improve error message display
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Optimize search form layout

## Short Term (1-2 Months)

### 5. Deployment Preparations
- [ ] Optimize application for Render.com deployment
- [ ] Setup production configurations
- [ ] Implement environment-specific settings
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Complete user documentation
- [ ] Add API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Improve code comments and docstrings
- [ ] Create system architecture diagram

### 7. Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Improve recommendation relevance
- [ ] Add user preference tracking
- [ ] Enhance game analysis with more metrics
- [ ] Add basic analytics for search usage

### 8. Security Improvements
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Improve authentication security
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection

## Medium Term (3-6 Months)

### 9. Background Processing Upgrade
- [ ] Replace thread-based processing with Celery
- [ ] Setup Redis for task queue
- [ ] Implement persistent task status storage
- [ ] Add admin panel for task monitoring

### 10. Database Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Firestore usage
- [ ] Consider migration to proper game database
- [ ] Implement better caching strategy
- [ ] Add database monitoring

### 11. Advanced Features
- [ ] User similarity recommendations
- [ ] Social sharing for lists
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Advanced search operators

### 12. Scaling Preparation
- [ ] Load testing and performance optimization
- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling strategy
- [ ] Improve resource management
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting

## Long Term (6+ Months)

### 13. API Development
- [ ] Create public API for external applications
- [ ] Implement API authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting and usage tiers
- [ ] Create API documentation

### 14. Machine Learning Improvements
- [ ] Train custom embedding model for games
- [ ] Implement personalized search ranking
- [ ] Add automated game categorization
- [ ] Create user preference learning

### 15. Community Features
- [ ] User profiles and public lists
- [ ] Comments and discussions
- [ ] User-contributed content
- [ ] Curator recommendations

### 16. Mobile Experience
- [ ] Create progressive web app
- [ ] Optimize for mobile-first experience
- [ ] Add offline capabilities
- [ ] Implement push notifications

## Technical Debt Tracking

| Item | Priority | Estimated Effort | Notes |
|------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Deep search implementation | High | Medium | Needs more robust error handling |
| Thread-based background tasks | Medium | High | Replace with proper job queue |
| Error handling inconsistency | High | Medium | Standardize across all endpoints |
| Test coverage gaps | High | Medium | Prioritize critical paths |
| App.py size and complexity | Medium | Low | Continue modularization | 
| API endpoint documentation | Medium | Low | Create OpenAPI specification |
| Frontend code organization | Low | Medium | Improve JS organization |

## Dependencies and Blockers

- Firebase authentication integration must be complete before certain user features
- Deep search improvements needed before scaling to more users
- Test framework should be in place before major refactoring

## Metrics for Success

- Search relevance: >80% of searches return highly relevant results
- Performance: Search results in <3 seconds for regular searches
- Error rate: <1% of requests result in 5xx errors
- Test coverage: >70% of core functionality covered by tests
