# Documentation Auto-Update Rule

## Purpose

This rule ensures that all project documentation files are automatically updated whenever you make changes to the codebase using Cursor Agents. This maintains accurate and up-to-date documentation without manual intervention.

## Instructions for AI


After completing your primary task (implementing features, fixing bugs, adding tests, etc.), you MUST update all relevant documentation files to reflect the changes. Follow these specific instructions:

### 1. Update [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](mdc:docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
- Update the "Current Development Status" section
- Update the "Recent Changes" section with a brief description of what was changed
- Update the "Testing Status" if tests were added or modified
- Update any other relevant sections
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom

### 2. Update [TESTING_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/TESTING_ROADMAP.md)
If your changes involve tests:
- Update the checkboxes in the "Critical Test Cases" section
- Update the status indicators in the component tables
- Add any new test requirements that arise from your changes
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom

### 3. Update [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
- Check off completed tasks
- Update the status of ongoing tasks
- Move tasks between priority sections if appropriate
- Update the "Technical Debt Tracking" table if debt was added or resolved
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom

### 4. Update [LLM_CHALLENGES.md](mdc:docs/LLM_CHALLENGES.md)
If any challenges or effective strategies were discovered during implementation:
- Add them to the appropriate section
- Include concrete examples
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom

### Documentation Update Process

1. Always read the current content of documentation files before updating them
2. Make targeted, precise edits to the relevant sections
3. Keep the same formatting and style as the existing content
4. Use checkmarks (✅), warning signs (⚠️), or other existing indicators consistently
5. Include today's date in the "Last Updated" field at the bottom of each file you modify

### Important Notes

- If a feature implementation spans multiple files or components, include all relevant details in the documentation
- Documentation updates should be factual and objective, based on the actual changes made
- Include enough detail that someone reading the documentation would understand what changed and why
- Never overwrite the entire file; only update the relevant sections

## Confirmation Requirement

After updating documentation, briefly summarize which files were updated and what changes were made to each one. This should be a short bullet list at the end of your response.
